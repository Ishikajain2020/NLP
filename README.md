Text summarization is a vital task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that plays a crucial role in information retrieval, content curation, and document understanding. At its core, text summarization aims to distill the most relevant and essential information from a given document, be it a lengthy article, research paper, news report, or any other textual content. 
In doing so, it enables individuals and automated systems to obtain concise yet informative representations of the original text.
The significance of text summarization is underscored by the ever-increasing volume of digital information available, which often overwhelms readers and consumers of content. NLP-based summarization techniques offer a means to tackle this information overload, making it easier to consume and utilize large volumes of text efficiently.
Text summarization is the process of generating a shorter, coherent, and informative version of a longer document or text. The goal is to capture the essential points, ideas, and key information while reducing the overall length. There are two primary approaches to text summarization:
1. Extractive Summarization: This method selects and extracts sentences or phrases directly from the original text to create a summary.
                             It usually involves ranking sentences by importance and choosing the top-ranked sentences. Extractive summarization maintains the original wording but can lack fluency.
2. Abstractive Summarization: Abstractive summarization generates summaries by paraphrasing and rephrasing the content of the source text in a more human-readable form.It involves understanding the source text and generating novel sentences. This approach often results in more coherent and fluent summaries.

In this project we are working on Abstractive Summarization of text.
